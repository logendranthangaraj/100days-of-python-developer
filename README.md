# 100 Days of Python Developer 🐍

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python Developer** journey! This repository is a record of my daily practice, experiments, and projects as I strengthen my Python skills and explore real-world applications.

## 🚀 About the Project
The goal of this repository is to commit to **100 days of consistent Python practice**, covering a wide range of topics, including:

- Python basics (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data structures and algorithms
- File handling and databases
- Web scraping
- APIs and automation
- Data analysis with libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`
- Project-based mini applications

This is not just coding—it’s **learning by building, documenting, and iterating every day**.

## 📅 How This Works
- Each day focuses on a **specific concept, challenge, or project**.  
- Code is committed daily with explanations or notes.  
- Mini-projects are included to consolidate learning.  
- By the end of 100 days, the repository will be a **comprehensive Python portfolio**.

## 💡 Why “100 Days”?
The “100 Days of Code” challenge is a popular method for building consistency, improving coding skills, and creating visible progress. By sharing my journey, I hope to **inspire and help other developers**.
